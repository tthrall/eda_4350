The primary reference is `eda_v3`:\n\n-   Notes on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n    -   MATH4350 version 3\n    -   by Karen Trageser\n\nThe subsequent material for the course is based on the following `ml` reference:\n\n-   Machine Learning: a Concise Introduction\n    -   by Steven W. Knox\n    -   next edition pending publication by Wiley\n    -   (Course notes: ML Topics & Techniques, version 2.93)\n\nWe first compare the `eda_v3` content to the selection of last week's topics.  We'll then form small teams to select topics for discussion in the remainder of the session.\n\n## Overview of Topics\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nHere are the chapter titles of `eda_v3`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: EDA v3 chapters\n\n| chpt|title                            |\n|----:|:--------------------------------|\n|    1|Introduction                     |\n|    2|Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  |\n|    3|Unsupervised Learning            |\n|    4|Some Linear Algebra              |\n|    5|Dimension Reduction              |\n|    6|Topic Modeling                   |\n|    7|Sampling                         |\n|    8|Time Series                      |\n|    9|App-A: Probability Review        |\n|   10|App-B: SVD Notes by Carla Martin |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd here are the topics we discussed last week.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Topics discussed Jan 13-17\n\n|date       |time |topic                                             |\n|:----------|:----|:-------------------------------------------------|\n|2025-01-13 |AM   |Exploratory Data Analysis                         |\n|2025-01-13 |PM   |Conditional Distributions                         |\n|2025-01-14 |AM   |Clustering: EDA in Higher Dimensions              |\n|2025-01-14 |PM   |Text Analysis                                     |\n|2025-01-15 |AM   |Sampling and Study Design                         |\n|2025-01-15 |PM   |Linear Algebra                                    |\n|2025-01-16 |AM   |Dimension Reduction                               |\n|2025-01-17 |AM   |Time Series                                       |\n|2025-01-17 |PM   |Time Series & Point Processes: Frequency Analysis |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Class Exercise: Select Topics for Further Discussion\n\nWhich topics presented last week merit further discussion? Which topics from `eda_v3` would you like to know more about? Form a team of 2-4 classmates, and take 10 minutes to record the 1-2 topics of greatest interest to you. We'll then use the remainder of the session to discuss them and follow up with write-ups.\n\n## Topics Nominated for Further Discussion\n\nHere are the topics nominated for further discussion by one or more teams.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Topics Nominated by Teams\n\n|topic                            | n_teams|\n|:--------------------------------|-------:|\n|Time Series Forecasting          |       2|\n|LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation |       2|\n|SVD:Singular Value Decomposition |       1|\n|KDE: Kernel Density Estimation   |       1|\n|Clustering                       |       1|\n|PCA v MDS v SNE: when to use?    |       1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
