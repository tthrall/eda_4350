## Introduction

The aim of this session is to review sessions of the previous week, in order to prepare to present this material going forward. The primary reference is `eda_v3`:

-   Notes on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    -   MATH4350 version 3
    -   by Karen Trageser

The subsequent material for the course is based on the following `ml` reference:

-   Machine Learning: a Concise Introduction
    -   by Steven W. Knox
    -   next edition pending publication by Wiley
    -   (Course notes: ML Topics & Techniques, version 2.93)

We first compare the `eda_v3` content to the selection of last week's topics.  We'll then form small teams to select topics for discussion in the remainder of the session.

## Overview of Topics

```{r eda_v3_outline}
eda_v3_outline <- read_tsv(
  file = here("data", "retain", "eda_v3_outline.txt")) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(across(
    .cols = idx_1:i_pg, 
    .fns  = as.integer))
```

```{r jan_13_17_topics}
jan_13_17_topics <- read_tsv(
  file = here("data", "retain", "jan_13_17_topics.txt")) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(dt_session = lubridate::dmy(dt_session)) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(across(
    .cols = c(idx_1, idx_2, idx_3, pg_doc), 
    .fns  = as.integer))
```

Here are the chapter titles of `eda_v3`.

```{r eda_v3_outline__kable}
eda_v3_outline |> 
  dplyr::filter(
    idx_2 == 0L, idx_3 == 0L
  ) |> 
  dplyr::select(idx_1, title) |> 
   knitr::kable(
     caption = "EDA v3 chapters", 
     col.names = c("chpt", "title")
   )
```

And here are the topics we discussed last week.

```{r jan_13_17_topics__kable}
jan_13_17_topics |> 
  dplyr::filter(
    idx_2 == 0L, idx_3 == 0L
  ) |> 
  dplyr::select(dt_session, am_pm, title) |> 
   knitr::kable(
     caption = "Topics discussed Jan 13-17", 
     col.names = c("date", "time", "topic")
   )
```

## Class Exercise: Select Topics for Further Discussion

Which topics presented last week merit further discussion? Which topics from `eda_v3` would you like to know more about? Form a team of 2-4 classmates, and take 10 minutes to record the 1-2 topics of greatest interest to you. We'll then use the remainder of the session to discuss them and follow up with write-ups.

## Topics Nominated for Further Discussion

Here are the topics nominated for further discussion by one or more teams.

```{r topics_for_discussion}
topics_for_discussion <- tibble::tribble(
  ~topic, ~n_teams, 
  "Time Series Forecasting", 2L, 
  "LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation", 2L, 
  "SVD:Singular Value Decomposition", 1L, 
  "KDE: Kernel Density Estimation", 1L, 
  "Clustering", 1L, 
  "PCA v MDS v SNE: when to use?", 1L
)

# save file just once
save_file <- FALSE
if (save_file) {
  topics_for_discussion |> write_tsv(here(
    "data", "retain", "topics_for_discussion.txt"
  ))
}
```

```{r topics_for_discussion__kable}
topics_for_discussion |> knitr::kable(
  caption = "Topics Nominated by Teams"
)
```
