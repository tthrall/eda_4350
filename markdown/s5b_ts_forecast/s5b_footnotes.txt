[^stationary]: The assumption of second-order (or wide-sense) stationarity suffices for most time series models used in practice, but some cases may call for the assumption of *strict stationarity*. This means that for any finite set of times $(t_1, \ldots, t_K)$ and any time-shift $s$, the joint probability distribution of $(X_\bullet (t_1), \ldots, X_\bullet (t_K))$ is identical to that of $(X_\bullet (t_1 - s), \ldots, X_\bullet (t_K - s))$.

[^cmort_trend]: The authors consider various forms for the function $f(t)$: a linear function, a quadratic function, or a locally smoothed version of $X_1(t)$.

[^faithful]: There are two prominent `R` packages representing the Old Faithful measurements during August, 1985. The `MASS::geyser` data set of 299 observations [@MASS] includes nocturnal measurements whose duration was coded as 2, 3 or 4 minutes, having originally been described as ‘short’, ‘medium’ or ‘long’. The `datasets::faithful` data set of 272 measurements, shown in the figure, excludes 27 of these nocturnal measurements.

[^gtemp]: The data source is [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/), who use the term "anomaly" rather than "deviation". Further clarifications are pending.

[^djia]: The return is here calculated as $log_e$ of the ratio: current day's closing price divided by that of the preceding day. The median value is about 6 basis points.

[^ma_5]: The example illustrates a simple moving average. A weighted moving average may have non-negative coefficients that sum to unity. The term "moving average" is also used more broadly to mean a component of a time series model that filters an uncorrelated noise sequence.

[^rho_ma_1]: Note that $\rho_X (1)$ is restricted to the interval $(-0.5, 0.5)$, since we have restricted $\theta$ to the interval $(-1, 1)$.

[^astsa_ESS]: The `R` package `astsa` provides function `ESS()`.

[^white_noise]: The authors generally use the notation $W(t)$ to signify white noise, an uncorrelated stationary random process having mean 0.  Moreover, the authors typically reserve this notation to signify an uncorrelated stationary _Gaussian_ process, that is, a process of independent and identically distributed normal variables having mean 0.
